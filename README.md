> A mathematical explainer of dynamic programming.

Dynamic programming is more of a concept and a way of thinking rather than a specific algorithm or data structure, which is why it is hard for programmers to grasp, and especially to apply in actual problems.

This document intends to address this by introducing dynamic programming through the original mathematical definition, the bellman equation, which will provide a much more specific and concrete framework (and formula) for you to solve dynamic programming problems with.

You can read the explainer [here](./dynamic-programming.pdf).
